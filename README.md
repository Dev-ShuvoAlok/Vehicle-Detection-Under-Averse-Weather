# Weather-Aware Vehicle Detection Using Hybrid YOLOv8 with Attention Mechanism
Road accidents are a major concern worldwide, with approximately 20-25%
occurring during adverse weather conditions. Although vehicle classification is
an essential part of intelligent transportation systems, it often performs poorly
in challenging conditions such as snow, fog, and rain. These circumstances limit
overall system reliability by reducing visual features and decreasing detection
accuracy. In this research, we have proposed an enhanced hybrid object detec-
tion model based on the YOLOv8 architecture for robust vehicle detection in
adverse weather conditions. The proposed model integrates EfficientNetB2 as the
backbone network and incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM) to improve feature representation and localization accuracy. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on the DAWN dataset,
a benchmark for object detection under diverse adverse weather conditions. Our
model achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.93% with an inference
time of 7.58 milliseconds, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy
and speed. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed method outperforms
cutting-edge detection models in terms of accuracy and robustness under adverse
weather conditions. These outcomes demonstrate how well attention mechanisms
and efficient backbones can be combined to improve detection performance. The
suggested model facilitates the development of dependable vision-based systems
for applications involving autonomous driving and intelligent transportation.
